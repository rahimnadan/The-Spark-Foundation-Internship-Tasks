# The-Spark-Foundation-Internship-Tasks

This repository contains seven projects completed as part of The Spark Foundation Internship.

## Task 1 - Supervised ML

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the scores of students based on the number of hours they study. The results of the project show that there is a positive correlation between the number of hours studied and the scores obtained.

## Task 2 - Unsupervised ML

This project aims to cluster customers based on their spending habits. The results of the project show that there are three distinct customer segments based on their spending habits.

## Task 3 - EDA

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on the sample superstore dataset provided by The Spark Foundation. The results of the project show that the most profitable category is technology.

## Task 4 - Terrorism EDA

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on the Global Terrorism Database. The results of the project show that the most affected country is Iraq.

## Task 5 - Sports EDA

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on the Indian Premier League dataset. The results of the project show that Mumbai Indians is the most successful team in the IPL.

## Task 6 - Decision Tree Algorithm

This project aims to build a decision tree classifier to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features. The results of the project show that the decision tree classifier is able to predict the species of an iris flower with high accuracy.

## Task 7 - Stock Market Prediction project

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the stock prices of a company based on its historical data. The results of the project show that the machine learning model is able to predict the stock prices with reasonable accuracy.

:rocket: Happy coding!
